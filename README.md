# 737-Sim-Control-Loading-Interface
A software solution for the Boeing 737 Simulator Control Loading System at the University of Liverpool.

## Introduction
### Control Loading System
A Control Loading System (or CLS) is an electromechanical system used to provide pilots with realistic flight control forces in a flight simulator. 

### Context
At the University of Liverpool, a full-cockpit, fixed-based Boeing 737 simulator requires a software update for its CLS. This simulator has been converted from a BAe Nimrod MRA4 which had a fully functioning CLS over a decade ago. Due to the upgrade in operating system and flight simulator software, the CLS no longer functions as desired. This repository attempts to address this issue.
